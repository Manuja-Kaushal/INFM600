**Focal Data** http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2010-census-populations-by-zip-code

**2010_Census_Populations_by_Zip_Code.csv**

This file includes data about Census Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics held in 2010. In this dataset, zip codes are limited to those that fall at least partially within LA city boundaries. This dataset includes important details such as Zip Code, Total Population, Median age, Total Males, Total Females, Total Households, Average Household Size.

**Supporting Data Sets**

**Water_Use_Average_By_Zipcode.csv**

This data set includes information about the residential water use by month averaged for fiscal year. The values in the dataset represent Hundred Cubic Feet (HCF) of water use. It has data values describing water consumption for eight fiscal years such as 05/06, 06/07, 07/08, 08/09, 09/10, 10/11, 11/12 12/13 and zip code of LA city boundaries.

**Average_monthly_residential_energy_usage_By_zip_code.csv**

This data set includes information about the residential energy use (averaged monthly) for each fiscal year since 2003 in kilowatt hours (kWh). It has data values describing energy consumption for eight fiscal years such as 05/06, 06/07, 07/08, 08/09, 09/10, 10/11, 11/12 12/13 and zip code of LA city boundaries.

**Merged Dataset**

**Resource_Usage_By_Zipcode.csv**

This data set uses the data from the focal data set and the supporting datasets. It consists values of energy and water consumption linked together by zip codes which are of LA city boundaries.

---------------
Analysis
---------------

**Do areas having median age(25 to 3) are likely to consume more water and residential energy?**

We viewed all the three datasets taken from data.gov and merged it to a single one.
On basis of median age provided for each zipcodes, we proposed that age might be a factor affecting energy and water consumption of LA city boundaries.
